*WebdriverIO is a progressive automation framework built to automate modern web and mobile applications. It simplifies the interaction with your app and provides a set of plugins that help you create a scalable, robust and flakiness test suite.*

**It is designed to be:**

 - Extendable - Adding helper functions, or more complicated sets and combinations of existing commands is simple and really useful
 - Compatible - WebdriverIO can be run on the WebDriver Protocol for  true cross-browser testing as well as Chrome DevTools Protocol for Chromium based automation using Puppeteer. 
 - Feature Rich - The huge variety of built-in and community plugins allows you to easily integrate and extend your setup to fulfill your requirements.

You can use WebdriverIO to automate:

 - üåê   modern web applications written in React, Vue, Angular, Svelte
   or other frontend frameworks
 - üì±   hybrid or native mobile applications running in an
   emulator/simulator or on a real device
 - üíª   native desktop applications (e.g. written with Electron.js)
